# Airline-Passenger-Satisfaction-Classification
Welcome. This repository contains the code and data necessary to make a machine learning classification model. 
This is made for practicing and learning, since I'm still in early stages to become a Data Scientits o Machine Learning Specialist the only way to learn is to practice. 

This notebook looks into using various python-based Machine Learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a Machine Learning Model capable of predicting what is the satistfaction of a airline passenger. In addition, it looks into what factor are highly correlated to passenger's satisfaction
